        <h2><i>About Frank Gehry</i></h2>
        <br>
        <p>Frank Owen Gehry is a Canadian-born American architect and designer.
        A number of his buildings, including his private residence in Santa Monica, California,
        have become world-renowned attractions. His works are considered among the most important of
        contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, leading Vanity Fair to call
        him "the most important architect of our age". He is also the designer of the National Dwight D.
